# Changelog

All notable changes to **OpenCowork** will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **CronAgent profile** — dedicated agent preset for autonomous cron job execution with tailored system prompt.
- **X.com posting skill** — new skill enabling the agent to compose and publish posts to X.com (Twitter).
- **Cron system improvements** — global job management with concurrency tracking, preventing overlapping runs and improving scheduler reliability.

### Changed
- **macOS-native layout overhaul** — refactored window chrome to use a native title bar on macOS, replaced the horizontal top bar with a vertical navigation rail, and introduced a unified toolbar housing the mode switcher (Cowork/Code) and export actions for a cleaner, more platform-consistent UI.
- **English-first documentation** — rewrote README with comprehensive English documentation covering multi-agent architecture, 15+ SubAgents, messaging platform integrations, and technical deep-dive; added detailed English repository guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`) covering project structure, build commands, coding style, and development workflow.

### Fixed
- **OpenAI-compatible provider stream termination** — streaming now waits for the usage chunk when it is not included in the `finish_reason` event, preventing premature stream closure and missing token usage data with OpenAI-compatible providers.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Specialized agent presets** — introduced eight curated agent profiles (API design, architecture review, code review, copywriting, data analysis, debugging, DevOps, and documentation) with tailored system prompts so teams can spin up the right expert quicker.
- **Public documentation site** — launched an accompanying Next.js documentation hub (built with Fumadocs + Docker support) that mirrors the in-app architecture references and provides a polished onboarding path.

### Changed
- Updated marketing homepage hero badge to highlight the new v0.2.2 release.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Auto-updater for Windows/Linux** — new `setupAutoUpdater` wiring in the main process with postpone logic, localized dialogs, release-note display, download progress indicators, and crash-log instrumentation so packaged builds can fetch binary updates directly from GitHub Releases.
- **Mermaid diagram rendering in chat** — assistant messages now render ` ```mermaid ` code blocks as themed SVG diagrams with one-click copy for source or rendered image output, plus dark/light theme sync via `mermaid-theme.ts`.

### Changed
- **Build & release pipeline** — `electron-builder.yml`, `dev-app-update.yml`, and the GitHub Actions workflow now publish release artifacts (including `latest.yml`, `.AppImage.zsync`, etc.) to GitHub Releases so the auto-updater has consistent feeds across platforms.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Feishu DM title mismatch** — added `getUserProfile` and cached user display names inside the Feishu service so P2P sessions fall back to the sender's real name whenever `chatName` is missing, keeping private chat titles aligned with Feishu.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Fixed Windows build crash** — removed `nanoid` from the `electron-builder.yml` exclude list. The `nanoid` module is required by the main process (cron handlers, plugin handlers, auto-reply) and was incorrectly excluded from the packaged app, causing "Cannot find module 'nanoid'" errors on startup.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Multi-platform messaging plugins** — new Discord, Telegram, WeCom (企业微信), and WhatsApp provider implementations, each with WebSocket message parsing, API wrappers, and service classes. All providers extend a shared `BasePluginService` + `WebSocketTransport` abstraction for consistent lifecycle management and auto-reconnect.
- **Plugin auto-reply pipeline** — `auto-reply.ts` routes incoming plugin messages to per-user/per-group sessions and triggers the Agent Loop for autonomous replies; renderer-side `use-plugin-auto-reply` hook manages the full approval + execution flow. Includes `forceApproval` mode that gates all tool calls through user permission when running on behalf of plugin messages.
- **Per-session provider binding** — sessions can now bind a specific `providerId` + `modelId`, allowing plugin auto-reply sessions to use a dedicated model instead of the global active provider. DB schema extended with `provider_id`, `model_id`, and `external_chat_id` columns.
- **Cron scheduling system** — persistent `node-cron` scheduler (`cron-scheduler.ts`) with SQLite-backed job storage, IPC handlers, and renderer tools (`CronAdd`/`CronUpdate`/`CronDelete`/`CronList`). Supports one-shot (`at`), fixed-interval (`every`), and cron-expression schedules. Dedicated `CronAgent` sub-agent runs tasks autonomously on trigger. Cron jobs support plugin routing via `plugin_id`/`plugin_chat_id` for delivering results to messaging platforms.
- **Cron management UI** — full `CronPanel` in the cowork sidebar with job list, status badges, run history, and inline editing controls.
- **Notify tool & toast system** — `Notify` tool sends desktop toast notifications or injects messages into sessions; `NotifyWindow` renders a standalone overlay with progress bars, auto-dismiss, and pin support.
- **Browser Session Crawler skill** — Playwright-based crawling skill that reuses Chrome/Edge login sessions, with pre-built scripts for Xiaohongshu and Zhihu.
- **Extended file preview viewers** — new DOCX, PDF, image, and Markdown viewers registered alongside the existing spreadsheet viewer.
- **Feishu rich messaging API** — expanded `feishu-api.ts` with group list, message history, user info, reply capabilities, and file/image send tools (`FeishuSendFile`, `FeishuSendImage`).
- **`CLAUDE.md` project guide** — comprehensive architecture reference and development instructions for AI-assisted coding.
- **External `triggerSendMessage` entry point** — allows plugin auto-reply and other non-hook callers to invoke `sendMessage` from outside the React hook lifecycle.

### Changed
- **Plugin architecture refactored** — extracted `BasePluginService` base class and `WebSocketTransport` utility; DingTalk and Feishu services migrated to the shared abstraction with dedicated `WsMessageParser` modules. Plugin store uses window-level flags to prevent HMR duplicate listener registration; enabling a plugin now auto-activates it.
- **Plugin settings UI overhauled** — `PluginPanel` redesigned with per-provider configuration forms, auto-reply toggles, connection status indicators, and group/contact management for all six providers.
- **System prompt major overhaul** — "Think Before Acting" expanded to a 6-step process (Understand → Scope → Plan → Risk check → Act → Verify); added output calibration examples; code safety rules (XSS, injection, secrets); tool anti-pattern guidelines; API and Shell security rules; plugin file-delivery instructions injected when Feishu is active.
- **Agent Teams prompt dynamically trimmed** — full team workflow instructions only injected when a team is active; otherwise a compact summary is used, reducing idle token overhead.
- **Dynamic context injection on every message** — previously only injected on the first user message per session; now injected on every turn. Removed bilingual logic (unified to English). Added timestamp to context header.
- **Session switching loads per-session tasks** — `setActiveSession` now triggers `loadTasksForSession` and `switchToolCallSession` so the task list and tool call panel reflect the active session immediately.
- **Queued message priority** — at `iteration_end`, if queued user messages exist the agent loop is aborted early so the next queued message is dispatched immediately instead of waiting for another LLM round-trip.
- **`<system-remind>` → `<system-reminder>`** — tag name unified across dynamic context, queued message reminders, and system prompt references.
- **Spreadsheet viewer improved** — richer rendering and interaction in `spreadsheet-viewer.tsx`.
- Locales (EN + ZH) updated with cron, notify, and new plugin strings.

### Fixed
- **Feishu WebSocket stability** — message parsing extracted to dedicated `parse-ws-message.ts`, improving reconnect reliability and error isolation.
- **DingTalk message parsing** — separated into standalone parser module for cleaner error handling.
- **Plugin-created sessions not found** — when a session created by the main process (e.g. plugin auto-reply) was not yet in the renderer store, `sendMessage` now reloads sessions from DB before aborting, preventing silent message drops.
- **Context compression respects session-bound provider** — compression now uses the session's bound `providerId`/`modelId` instead of always falling back to the global active provider.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Queued message workflow** — per-session FIFO queue with edit/save/delete controls in the composer so you can line up multiple drafts while a run is in progress.
- **Pending message IPC hooks** — renderer now subscribes to queue updates via `subscribePendingSessionMessages`/`getPendingSessionMessages`, keeping UI state and persisted drafts in sync across restarts.

### Changed
- **Composer history navigation** — arrow-key history now integrates with the queued drafts, restoring text, attachments, and metadata exactly as saved.
- **Auto-dispatch after runs** — the next queued draft is automatically sent as soon as the active agent loop finishes, reducing manual resend steps in multi-stage workflows.

### Fixed
- **Draft/attachment desync** — queue + history state now share a single source of truth, preventing stale attachments or mismatched drafts when editing/sending messages rapidly.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Crash logging pipeline** — new `src/main/crash-logger.ts` persists structured JSONL crash events to `~/.open-cowork/logs/crash-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, including process/runtime metadata and normalized payload snapshots.
- **Main-process crash/lifecycle hooks** — `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, `child-process-gone`, `render-process-gone`, `unresponsive`, and failed main-frame loads are now captured and written to crash logs.
- **Background command sessions** — bash commands can run as managed background processes with session/tool metadata, live output streaming, and stdin write support (`process:write`).
- **Interactive terminal controls in UI** — TopBar badges + DetailPanel terminal view + ToolCallCard actions now support opening, stopping, sending Ctrl+C, and sending stdin to running background commands.
- **Composer input history** — Input area now supports per-session up/down history recall (text + image attachments + draft restoration).

### Changed
- Bash tool now auto-detects long-running commands and runs them in background by default, with `run_in_background` and `force_foreground` controls.
- Provider resolution now supports per-model protocol override (`model.type`), base URL normalization by protocol, and builtin model merging that preserves user-enabled flags while syncing preset metadata.
- Builtin provider lineup expanded with coding-oriented presets (Moonshot/Qwen/Baidu/MiniMax) and refreshed model catalogs in presets (including GPT-5.* / Codex variants and updated thinking configs).
- Agent/tool observability improved with foreground shell exec tracking, richer process state in store, and clearer status surfacing in panel components.

### Fixed
- **OpenAI Responses tools schema** now uses the correct Responses format (`type/name/description/parameters/strict`) instead of Chat-style nested `function`, fixing `Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].name'`.
- OpenAI-compatible chat streaming now exits safely for providers that do not terminate SSE after `tool_calls`/`stop`, preventing hangs in tool argument streaming.
- Agent loop now handles partial/malformed tool argument streams more robustly and finalizes dangling tool calls defensively when providers miss explicit `tool_call_end`.
- `Write` tool now performs explicit input validation and surfaces IPC write failures as tool errors instead of silently returning ambiguous success payloads.
- Session cleanup now tears down session-bound background processes to avoid orphaned runtime state.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Plan Mode pipeline** — new Plan panel, Zustand store, and Enter/ExitPlanMode tools enforce plan-first workflows, write plans to session `.plan/*.md` files, and surface status inside the cowork panel.
- **AskUserQuestion tool & card** — reactive chat card that collects single/multi-select answers (with "Other" free text) and streams results back to the tool call without blocking the UI.
- **Dynamic context injection** — first user turn in Cowork/Code modes automatically includes task/plan/file context, reducing repeated instructions for the agent loop.
- **Persistent plans & tasks tables** — SQLite schema, DAO modules, and IPC handlers store plans/tasks per session for reliable restarts.
- **Shell execution upgrades** — UTF-8 normalization on Windows, binary-output detection, truncation safeguards, and live `shell:output` streaming via exec IDs.
- **Provider preset refresh** — latest OpenRouter/Xiaomi models with thinking configs and pricing metadata plus lazy Monaco-powered fallback viewer for file previews.

### Changed
- Agent loop and chat actions honor plan-mode tool allowlists, auto-register MCP/plugin tools per session, and inject richer debug metadata.
- Right panel layout (Steps, Plan, Artifacts, preview) updated for plan awareness; Command Palette/AppSidebar and localization strings synced with the new workflow.
- Settings pages and provider labels expanded for AskUser/Plan terminology, with improved animated transitions and syntax highlighting lazily loaded as needed.

### Fixed
- Session teardown now clears running-state flags, AskUser pending questions, auto-triggered teammate queues, and plan-mode toggles to avoid leaking into future runs.
- SQLite racing conditions in sessions/tasks/plans DAO layers resolved, ensuring foreign-key safe inserts/updates and consistent IPC responses.
- Shell tool no longer crashes on binary output or garbled encoding; chat tool cards correctly render long tool inputs/outputs with truncation markers.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) full pipeline** — main-process multi-connection manager supporting stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP transports; IPC endpoints for lifecycle control; renderer-side tool bridge that injects MCP tools into the agent loop.
- **Settings → MCP panel** — create, edit, and manage MCP server configs with transport-aware forms, live capability refresh, and connection status controls.
- **Chat composer MCP awareness** — MCP servers appear in the Skills menu and as inline badges; users can toggle MCP capabilities per session before sending a message.
- **Gitee AI provider preset refresh** — curated DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, ERNIE, and Hunyuan models with accurate token limits and thinking support flags.
- **System prompt language injection** — agent system prompt now includes the user's selected language so AI responses match the UI locale.
- **Animated transitions component** (`animate-ui/transitions.tsx`) for smoother UI state changes.
- **Confirm dialog component** (`ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`) for destructive action confirmations.

### Changed
- README repositioned as the open-source Claude Cowork alternative; added provider comparison table, download links, and streamlined quick-start guide.
- Locales (EN + ZH) gained MCP-related strings, ensuring consistent translations across chat and settings screens.
- Settings page restructured with tabbed layout and expanded provider configuration.
- `AssistantMessage`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolCallCard`, and `FileChangeCard` components refactored for cleaner rendering and better streaming display.
- Layout simplified — `Layout.tsx` reduced by ~400 lines; panel logic extracted into dedicated components.
- Chat store enhanced with improved session management and message persistence.

### Fixed
- Chat input warnings and badges now reliably reflect active providers, MCP servers, and context window usage before running agent tasks.
