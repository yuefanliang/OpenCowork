- **Skill docs clarity** — docx-creator guide gained a generated table of contents, formatting tips, and explicit dependency recovery instructions to align with the new CLI switches.
- **ProviderStore hydration** — provider presets merge strategy now keeps custom overrides while ensuring built-in protocols, default models, and thinking configs stay current after app upgrades.

### Fixed
- **Tool diff folding** — Large inline diffs now fold untouched context with expandable sections, preventing the chat thread from ballooning when applying multi-file patches.
- **Bash console controls** — background shell cards keep scroll position synced while streaming, expose exit codes reliably, and disable stop/send-input buttons once processes complete.
- **Detail panel regressions** — resolved missing open/close state in `useUIStore` so clicking any SubAgent/Tool detail button consistently opens the right-side panel.
- **Docx tool dependency errors** — add explicit python-docx import guard (with install instructions) so missing dependencies surface immediately instead of crashing mid-run.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Feishu audio transcription** — implemented OpenAI-compatible speech-to-text API integration for processing voice messages in Feishu plugin conversations.

### Changed
- **Error message improvements** — refined user-facing error messages in plugin auto-reply flow with clearer Chinese text and better formatting.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Skill bootstrap path** — bundled skills are now copied into `~/agents/skills/` on startup (without overwriting user changes), aligning the renderer Skill tool with the main-process directory layout.
- **File mutation UI** — Right Panel, Tool cards, file change cards, and Translate timeline icons now focus on the Write/Edit/Delete tools that actually exist, so MultiEdit-only affordances are removed and stats stay accurate.
- **Provider test requests** — the Provider panel’s “Test connection” button selects the proper endpoint based on each model’s protocol (OpenAI Chat vs Responses vs Anthropic), enabling realistic health checks even with custom base URLs.
- **Clipboard export** — chat-to-image export now writes PNG data through the main-process clipboard IPC, fixing large-image copy failures on Windows caused by browser-side base64 conversions.

### Fixed
- **Translate agent buffer safety** — defensive Write handling prevents late completion/status strings from overwriting the translation buffer; agents now end with `TRANSLATION_DONE` without clobbering content.
- **Context menu alignment** — the mode-switch context menu spacing is restored (`gap-2`), keeping icons aligned with labels.

### Removed
- **Offline Skills Market cache** — the 1,800-line `resources/skills-market/skills.json` bundle and related downloader script were removed; Skills Market always queries the live API so the app footprint stays small.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **SFTP folder uploads** — the SSH file explorer can now select a local directory, compress it automatically, upload with progress updates, and unzip it on the remote server so large projects arrive intact.
- **Remote zip helper** — any remote directory can be compressed in-place from the explorer’s context menu, making it easier to download or archive server snapshots.
- **Public key bootstrap** — the SSH connection form can auto-detect local `~/.ssh` keys, copy the public key to the clipboard, and install it on the target host for passwordless auth in a couple of clicks.

### Changed
- **SSH upload pipeline** — uploads stream through a reusable session pool with richer progress reporting, cancellation, and automatic cleanup of temporary archives.
- **SSH UI polish** — file explorer menus surface the new folder upload/zip actions, and the connection form highlights public-key helper buttons directly next to auth inputs.

### Fixed
- **SFTP reliability** — remote folder creation, retries, and cursor pagination were hardened to keep large directory trees in sync even on slower servers.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **SSH workspace** — full SSH connection & group management with secure credential storage, per-connection terminals (xterm.js), file explorer/editor with diff-aware saves, remote preview panes, and the ability to bind a remote working directory to any chat session so the agent operates against server files natively.
- **Codex OAuth provider** — end-to-end PKCE OAuth flow with a local callback server, status indicators, quota extraction from response headers, and automatic registration of the bundled `codex-instructions.md` prompt, making Codex usable via a single toggle in the Provider panel.
- **Feishu member list tool** — new plugin tool + IPC wiring that lets agent automations fetch group member rosters on demand, exposing the capability in the Feishu plugin catalog for downstream skills.

### Changed
- **Provider / Plugin settings panels** — redesigned Provider panel shows OAuth status, quota usage, and dynamic field rendering, while the Plugin panel gains clearer permission warnings and reorganized toggles.
- **Planning & permission workflow** — Cowork PermissionDialog, PlanPanel, dynamic context, and Plan Store adjustments reinforce the "plan before execution" UX and surface explicit permission prompts inside auto-reply/plugin scenarios.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Global memory workspace** — new renderer + settings flows to load, edit, and persist `~/.open-cowork/MEMORY.md`, with automatic injection into system prompts for every chat/agent run.

- **Offline Skills Market data** — bundled `resources/skills-market/skills.json` plus renderer/main wiring so the skills panel can browse 180+ curated local entries without hitting the network.
- **Encrypted thinking capture** — OpenAI/Anthropic providers now request, persist, and replay encrypted reasoning blocks end-to-end, keeping telemetry secure while enabling richer debug info.

### Changed
- **Windows installer** — NSIS config now ships with customizable install directory (oneClick off + change-directory allowed) to match enterprise deployment expectations.
- **Primary layout & homepage** — macOS-style title bar, new Chat home screen, refined nav rail/right panel, and updated translate/settings surfaces for a more focused UX.
- **Provider & store plumbing** — refreshed provider presets (Gitee, Qwen, Routin, etc.), centralized translation store, and new IPC helpers for memory/files so advanced tools behave consistently.

### Fixed
- **Image preview safety** — clicking pasted/base64 images now opens an in-app dialog instead of spawning failing external windows on Windows systems.
- **Translation agent overwrites** — late-stage status strings (e.g. `TRANSLATION_DONE`) no longer clobber the final translated buffer after tool runs.
- **Working folder picker** — folder path appears only inside the selection dialog (home + session views), removing stray chrome above the input area.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-25

- **Mermaid diagram rendering in chat** — assistant messages now render ` ```mermaid ` code blocks as themed SVG diagrams with one-click copy for source or rendered image output, plus dark/light theme sync via `mermaid-theme.ts`.

### Changed
- **Build & release pipeline** — `electron-builder.yml`, `dev-app-update.yml`, and the GitHub Actions workflow now publish release artifacts (including `latest.yml`, `.AppImage.zsync`, etc.) to GitHub Releases so the auto-updater has consistent feeds across platforms.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Feishu DM title mismatch** — added `getUserProfile` and cached user display names inside the Feishu service so P2P sessions fall back to the sender's real name whenever `chatName` is missing, keeping private chat titles aligned with Feishu.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Fixed Windows build crash** — removed `nanoid` from the `electron-builder.yml` exclude list. The `nanoid` module is required by the main process (cron handlers, plugin handlers, auto-reply) and was incorrectly excluded from the packaged app, causing "Cannot find module 'nanoid'" errors on startup.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Multi-platform messaging plugins** — new Discord, Telegram, WeCom (企业微信), and WhatsApp provider implementations, each with WebSocket message parsing, API wrappers, and service classes. All providers extend a shared `BasePluginService` + `WebSocketTransport` abstraction for consistent lifecycle management and auto-reconnect.
- **Plugin auto-reply pipeline** — `auto-reply.ts` routes incoming plugin messages to per-user/per-group sessions and triggers the Agent Loop for autonomous replies; renderer-side `use-plugin-auto-reply` hook manages the full approval + execution flow. Includes `forceApproval` mode that gates all tool calls through user permission when running on behalf of plugin messages.
- **Per-session provider binding** — sessions can now bind a specific `providerId` + `modelId`, allowing plugin auto-reply sessions to use a dedicated model instead of the global active provider. DB schema extended with `provider_id`, `model_id`, and `external_chat_id` columns.
- **Cron scheduling system** — persistent `node-cron` scheduler (`cron-scheduler.ts`) with SQLite-backed job storage, IPC handlers, and renderer tools (`CronAdd`/`CronUpdate`/`CronDelete`/`CronList`). Supports one-shot (`at`), fixed-interval (`every`), and cron-expression schedules. Dedicated `CronAgent` sub-agent runs tasks autonomously on trigger. Cron jobs support plugin routing via `plugin_id`/`plugin_chat_id` for delivering results to messaging platforms.
- **Cron management UI** — full `CronPanel` in the cowork sidebar with job list, status badges, run history, and inline editing controls.
- **Notify tool & toast system** — `Notify` tool sends desktop toast notifications or injects messages into sessions; `NotifyWindow` renders a standalone overlay with progress bars, auto-dismiss, and pin support.
- **Browser Session Crawler skill** — Playwright-based crawling skill that reuses Chrome/Edge login sessions, with pre-built scripts for Xiaohongshu and Zhihu.
- **Extended file preview viewers** — new DOCX, PDF, image, and Markdown viewers registered alongside the existing spreadsheet viewer.
- **Feishu rich messaging API** — expanded `feishu-api.ts` with group list, message history, user info, reply capabilities, and file/image send tools (`FeishuSendFile`, `FeishuSendImage`).
- **`CLAUDE.md` project guide** — comprehensive architecture reference and development instructions for AI-assisted coding.
- **External `triggerSendMessage` entry point** — allows plugin auto-reply and other non-hook callers to invoke `sendMessage` from outside the React hook lifecycle.

### Changed
- **Plugin architecture refactored** — extracted `BasePluginService` base class and `WebSocketTransport` utility; DingTalk and Feishu services migrated to the shared abstraction with dedicated `WsMessageParser` modules. Plugin store uses window-level flags to prevent HMR duplicate listener registration; enabling a plugin now auto-activates it.
- **Plugin settings UI overhauled** — `PluginPanel` redesigned with per-provider configuration forms, auto-reply toggles, connection status indicators, and group/contact management for all six providers.
- **System prompt major overhaul** — "Think Before Acting" expanded to a 6-step process (Understand → Scope → Plan → Risk check → Act → Verify); added output calibration examples; code safety rules (XSS, injection, secrets); tool anti-pattern guidelines; API and Shell security rules; plugin file-delivery instructions injected when Feishu is active.
- **Agent Teams prompt dynamically trimmed** — full team workflow instructions only injected when a team is active; otherwise a compact summary is used, reducing idle token overhead.
- **Dynamic context injection on every message** — previously only injected on the first user message per session; now injected on every turn. Removed bilingual logic (unified to English). Added timestamp to context header.
- **Session switching loads per-session tasks** — `setActiveSession` now triggers `loadTasksForSession` and `switchToolCallSession` so the task list and tool call panel reflect the active session immediately.
- **Queued message priority** — at `iteration_end`, if queued user messages exist the agent loop is aborted early so the next queued message is dispatched immediately instead of waiting for another LLM round-trip.
- **`<system-remind>` → `<system-reminder>`** — tag name unified across dynamic context, queued message reminders, and system prompt references.
- **Spreadsheet viewer improved** — richer rendering and interaction in `spreadsheet-viewer.tsx`.
- Locales (EN + ZH) updated with cron, notify, and new plugin strings.

### Fixed
- **Feishu WebSocket stability** — message parsing extracted to dedicated `parse-ws-message.ts`, improving reconnect reliability and error isolation.
- **DingTalk message parsing** — separated into standalone parser module for cleaner error handling.
- **Plugin-created sessions not found** — when a session created by the main process (e.g. plugin auto-reply) was not yet in the renderer store, `sendMessage` now reloads sessions from DB before aborting, preventing silent message drops.
- **Context compression respects session-bound provider** — compression now uses the session's bound `providerId`/`modelId` instead of always falling back to the global active provider.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Queued message workflow** — per-session FIFO queue with edit/save/delete controls in the composer so you can line up multiple drafts while a run is in progress.
- **Pending message IPC hooks** — renderer now subscribes to queue updates via `subscribePendingSessionMessages`/`getPendingSessionMessages`, keeping UI state and persisted drafts in sync across restarts.

### Changed
- **Composer history navigation** — arrow-key history now integrates with the queued drafts, restoring text, attachments, and metadata exactly as saved.
- **Auto-dispatch after runs** — the next queued draft is automatically sent as soon as the active agent loop finishes, reducing manual resend steps in multi-stage workflows.

### Fixed
- **Draft/attachment desync** — queue + history state now share a single source of truth, preventing stale attachments or mismatched drafts when editing/sending messages rapidly.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Crash logging pipeline** — new `src/main/crash-logger.ts` persists structured JSONL crash events to `~/.open-cowork/logs/crash-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, including process/runtime metadata and normalized payload snapshots.
- **Main-process crash/lifecycle hooks** — `uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`, `child-process-gone`, `render-process-gone`, `unresponsive`, and failed main-frame loads are now captured and written to crash logs.
- **Background command sessions** — bash commands can run as managed background processes with session/tool metadata, live output streaming, and stdin write support (`process:write`).
- **Interactive terminal controls in UI** — TopBar badges + DetailPanel terminal view + ToolCallCard actions now support opening, stopping, sending Ctrl+C, and sending stdin to running background commands.
- **Composer input history** — Input area now supports per-session up/down history recall (text + image attachments + draft restoration).

### Changed
- Bash tool now auto-detects long-running commands and runs them in background by default, with `run_in_background` and `force_foreground` controls.
- Provider resolution now supports per-model protocol override (`model.type`), base URL normalization by protocol, and builtin model merging that preserves user-enabled flags while syncing preset metadata.
- Builtin provider lineup expanded with coding-oriented presets (Moonshot/Qwen/Baidu/MiniMax) and refreshed model catalogs in presets (including GPT-5.* / Codex variants and updated thinking configs).
- Agent/tool observability improved with foreground shell exec tracking, richer process state in store, and clearer status surfacing in panel components.

### Fixed
- **OpenAI Responses tools schema** now uses the correct Responses format (`type/name/description/parameters/strict`) instead of Chat-style nested `function`, fixing `Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].name'`.
- OpenAI-compatible chat streaming now exits safely for providers that do not terminate SSE after `tool_calls`/`stop`, preventing hangs in tool argument streaming.
- Agent loop now handles partial/malformed tool argument streams more robustly and finalizes dangling tool calls defensively when providers miss explicit `tool_call_end`.
- `Write` tool now performs explicit input validation and surfaces IPC write failures as tool errors instead of silently returning ambiguous success payloads.
- Session cleanup now tears down session-bound background processes to avoid orphaned runtime state.

---

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Plan Mode pipeline** — new Plan panel, Zustand store, and Enter/ExitPlanMode tools enforce plan-first workflows, write plans to session `.plan/*.md` files, and surface status inside the cowork panel.
- **AskUserQuestion tool & card** — reactive chat card that collects single/multi-select answers (with "Other" free text) and streams results back to the tool call without blocking the UI.
- **Dynamic context injection** — first user turn in Cowork/Code modes automatically includes task/plan/file context, reducing repeated instructions for the agent loop.
- **Persistent plans & tasks tables** — SQLite schema, DAO modules, and IPC handlers store plans/tasks per session for reliable restarts.
- **Shell execution upgrades** — UTF-8 normalization on Windows, binary-output detection, truncation safeguards, and live `shell:output` streaming via exec IDs.
- **Provider preset refresh** — latest OpenRouter/Xiaomi models with thinking configs and pricing metadata plus lazy Monaco-powered fallback viewer for file previews.

### Changed
- Agent loop and chat actions honor plan-mode tool allowlists, auto-register MCP/plugin tools per session, and inject richer debug metadata.
- Right panel layout (Steps, Plan, Artifacts, preview) updated for plan awareness; Command Palette/AppSidebar and localization strings synced with the new workflow.
- Settings pages and provider labels expanded for AskUser/Plan terminology, with improved animated transitions and syntax highlighting lazily loaded as needed.

### Fixed
- Session teardown now clears running-state flags, AskUser pending questions, auto-triggered teammate queues, and plan-mode toggles to avoid leaking into future runs.
- SQLite racing conditions in sessions/tasks/plans DAO layers resolved, ensuring foreign-key safe inserts/updates and consistent IPC responses.
- Shell tool no longer crashes on binary output or garbled encoding; chat tool cards correctly render long tool inputs/outputs with truncation markers.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) full pipeline** — main-process multi-connection manager supporting stdio, SSE, and streamable HTTP transports; IPC endpoints for lifecycle control; renderer-side tool bridge that injects MCP tools into the agent loop.
- **Settings → MCP panel** — create, edit, and manage MCP server configs with transport-aware forms, live capability refresh, and connection status controls.
- **Chat composer MCP awareness** — MCP servers appear in the Skills menu and as inline badges; users can toggle MCP capabilities per session before sending a message.
- **Gitee AI provider preset refresh** — curated DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, ERNIE, and Hunyuan models with accurate token limits and thinking support flags.
- **System prompt language injection** — agent system prompt now includes the user's selected language so AI responses match the UI locale.
- **Animated transitions component** (`animate-ui/transitions.tsx`) for smoother UI state changes.
- **Confirm dialog component** (`ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`) for destructive action confirmations.

### Changed
- README repositioned as the open-source Claude Cowork alternative; added provider comparison table, download links, and streamlined quick-start guide.
- Locales (EN + ZH) gained MCP-related strings, ensuring consistent translations across chat and settings screens.
- Settings page restructured with tabbed layout and expanded provider configuration.
- `AssistantMessage`, `ThinkingBlock`, `ToolCallCard`, and `FileChangeCard` components refactored for cleaner rendering and better streaming display.
- Layout simplified — `Layout.tsx` reduced by ~400 lines; panel logic extracted into dedicated components.
- Chat store enhanced with improved session management and message persistence.

### Fixed
- Chat input warnings and badges now reliably reflect active providers, MCP servers, and context window usage before running agent tasks.
