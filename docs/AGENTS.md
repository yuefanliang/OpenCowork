# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/app/` contains Next.js App Router entries, including route groups (`(home)`), docs layout, API handlers (`api/search/route.ts`), and generated text endpoints (`llms*`, `og`).
- `src/components/` stores reusable UI and feature components.
- `src/lib/` holds shared utilities and layout helpers.
- `docs/` is the documentation content source (`*.mdx` + `meta.json` navigation files).
- `public/` contains static assets.
- `.source/` is generated by `fumadocs-mdx`; do not edit manually.
- `.next/` and `node_modules/` are build/dependency artifacts and must stay uncommitted.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install`: install dependencies (triggers `postinstall` MDX generation).
- `npm run dev`: start local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `npm run types:check`: regenerate doc collections, run Next type generation, then `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run build`: create a production build (`output: "standalone"`).
- `npm run start`: serve the production build.
- `docker compose up --build`: build and run the containerized production service.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use TypeScript-first, strict-safe code (`tsconfig.json` has `strict: true`).
- Follow existing 2-space indentation and semicolon conventions in project files.
- Use App Router naming (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `route.ts`) for routes and handlers.
- Prefer kebab-case for doc paths and MDX files (example: `getting-started/quick-start.mdx`).
- Use the `@/*` import alias for code under `src/`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No dedicated unit/integration test runner is configured yet.
- Treat `npm run types:check` and `npm run build` as required pre-merge checks.
- For doc/UI changes, validate in `npm run dev` and verify navigation, search, and Mermaid rendering.
- If you add a test framework, place tests in `src/**/__tests__/` or `src/**/*.{test,spec}.ts(x)` and add matching npm scripts.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Match existing history style: imperative, concise subjects such as `Add ...`, `Fix ...`, `Bump ...`, `Rewrite ...`.
- Keep commit subjects focused and explain motivation in the body when behavior changes.
- PRs should include scope, linked issue/context, and screenshots for visible docs/UI updates.
- Before opening a PR, confirm `npm run types:check` and `npm run build` pass locally.
