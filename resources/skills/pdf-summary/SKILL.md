# PDF Summary

Extract text from PDF files and produce structured summaries.

## When to use this skill

- User asks to summarize a PDF document
- User wants key points or an executive overview of a PDF
- User needs a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of a long PDF

## Steps

1. Ensure `pymupdf` is installed. If not:
   ```bash
   pip install pymupdf
   ```

2. Extract text from the PDF using the bundled script.

   ```bash
   python scripts/extract_text.py "INPUT_FILE_PATH"
   ```

   The script prints extracted text directly to stdout (page-separated). You do NOT need to read a separate file — just use the shell output.
   Options: `--quiet` (no page markers), `--save` (also write a .txt file), `--password <pwd>` (encrypted PDF).

3. Produce a summary based on the extracted text in this structure:
   - **Document**: title or filename
   - **Pages**: total count
   - **Executive Summary**: 2–3 sentence overview
   - **Key Points**: 5–10 bullet items
   - **Detailed Sections**: section-by-section breakdown (if requested)

## Edge cases

- **Scanned/image-only PDFs**: If extracted text is empty or garbled, inform the user that OCR is required and suggest `pip install pytesseract`.
- **Very large PDFs (100+ pages)**: Extract text first, then summarize in chunks rather than loading the entire text at once.
- **Password-protected PDFs**: `pymupdf` supports passwords — pass it via `fitz.open(path, password="xxx")`. Ask the user for the password if needed.

## Scripts

- [extract_text.py](scripts/extract_text.py) — Extract all pages as plain text
